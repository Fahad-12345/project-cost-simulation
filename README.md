# Project Cost Simulation using Monte Carlo Method

This Python project uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate and analyze project costs by generating thousands of possible cost outcomes based on a normal distribution. It also visualizes the results using histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDF).

---

## üìä What It Does

- Simulates 10,000 project costs using a normal distribution
- Calculates summary statistics:
  - Mean
  - Standard Deviation
  - Minimum and Maximum
  - 90th Percentile
- Visualizes the distribution of simulated costs:
  - Histogram with KDE
  - Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

## üß™ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
